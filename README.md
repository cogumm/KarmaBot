KarmaBot
========

KarmaBot is a little ruby-written irc bot that take note of user's karmas.

--------------------

How to use it?
--------------

To decrease karma for 'user' you must send a message to the channel where the
bot is working like 'user++', to decrease 'user--', to see "user"'s karma just
send '-karma user'.
You can vote only online users.

Nothing special, but working well :D
